ORM(Object Relational Mapper)/ODM ----> interface between express(works in js) and database(works in JSON)
ORM--> when SQL database is used
ODM--> when NOSQL database is used
ODM-->JS to JSON -->req
    JSON to JS --> res
    ex:- Mongoose

DB works with a server behind the scene(has it's own server with a unique port number)
