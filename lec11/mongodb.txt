-->in NOSQL we use collections in place of tables in SQL.

                                                FOR databases
                            SQL                                                     NOSQL
                        1.tables                                              1.collections
                                                                              -->Every single atomic entity inside a collection is a document

JSON is first converted to BSON (which is in binary format)and then is read by the system
BSON is faster than JSON
There are limited no. of datatypes in JSON(like boolean,no.,string, etc) but BSON gives more datatypes than JSON
